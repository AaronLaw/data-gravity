# Data Gravity
Data Gravity is an experimental Flask application that uses web APIs to
aggregate data that's important to my professional and personal life.


## Goals
There's several areas of metrics I want to measure that are important to
the work I'm doing.

### Personal Productivity
* Number of words written per day
* Stars and forks on important open source projects
* Some metric around amount of travel schedule (anticipate and prevent 
  burnout)

### General Software Development Interest
* Twitter and GitHub follower count over time and growth after specific events
* Uniques, sessions and pageviews for technical websites such as 
  [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/).

### Tech Events
* Calculate total number of tech events attended
* Measure Net Promoter Score for technical talks
* Associate relevant tweets to specific event for later reference
