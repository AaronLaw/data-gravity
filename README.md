# Data Gravity
Data Gravity is an experimental Flask application that uses web APIs to
aggregate data that's important to my professional and personal life.


## Measurement types
There are several important metrics to measure for my work. 

### Personal productivity
Productivity in my field is measured by writing, presenting and coding.

* Number of words written per day
* Stars and forks on in-progress open source projects

### Burnout prevention
Burnout is caused by high work effort into projects and activities that a
person does not feel like is making a difference. In my line of work the
primary activities that cause burnout are exhaustion from extensive travel,
emails taking precendence over more important tasks, having too many
meetings overload and major tasks at once which causes constant context 
switching.

* Percentage of current and upcoming travel days versus days in home city
* Email load (Gmail API)
* Average meetings per day, week and month (Google Calendar API)


### Tech Event Impact
* Twitter and GitHub follower count over time and growth after specific events
* Number of tech events attended (average per week, month and year)
* Measure Net Promoter Score for technical talks
* Associate relevant tweets to specific event for later reference


### Writing influence
* Uniques, sessions and pageviews for technical websites such as 
  [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/) and blog posts.


### Hypothetical (if possible)
* Current email response time
* Status and location (useful when I'm traveling and do not 
  respond immediately to emails)
* Number of developers helped
